# UIM_NAFE13388_FRDM_MCX

## What is this?   
NXP Analog-Front-End chip: NAFE13388 class driver and sample code for MCX series microcontrollers. 
This sample code works on those evaluation boards: *＊ [X-NAFE13388-UIM](https://www.nxp.com/design/design-center/development-boards-and-designs/analog-toolbox/arduino-shields-solutions/nafe13388-uim-8-channel-universal-input-afe-arduino-shield-board:NAFE13388-UIM) *＊ and FRDM-MCX. 
Currently supported MCU boards are..
- [FRDM-MCXN947](https://www.nxp.com/design/design-center/development-boards-and-designs/general-purpose-mcus/frdm-development-board-for-mcx-n94-n54-mcus:FRDM-MCXN947)
- [FRDM-MCXN236](https://www.nxp.com/design/design-center/development-boards-and-designs/general-purpose-mcus/frdm-development-board-for-mcx-n23x-mcus:FRDM-MCXN236)
- [FRDM-MCXA153](https://www.nxp.com/design/design-center/development-boards-and-designs/general-purpose-mcus/frdm-development-board-for-mcx-a14x-a15x-mcus:FRDM-MCXA153)

The sample code can build on MCUXpresso.
